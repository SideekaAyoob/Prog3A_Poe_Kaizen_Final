                    There is one plant that is needed for green tea but the key to creating the different teas is all in the
                    details of the preparation of the tea. This is from the way the tea is grown, the time until it is
                    harvested and the way the leaves are processed thereafter. Green tea starts its fermentation process
                    immediately after the leaves have been plucked from the stem of the plant. There are many ways that the
                    leaves maybe prepared thereafter (Steamed or roasted). And this leads to the many different types of
                    green tea. Certain Types of green can only be harvested at certain times in the year, the season and the
                    environment playing a very important factor in the taste of the product.

                    Kaizen originally grew and produced only 1 kind of green tea, sencha which is ‘the coffee in the morning
                    in the Asian community. 5 generations later and they have expanded not only the number of green teas they
                    plant and produce but have expanded their entire company.
